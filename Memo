  I actually learned a lot with this assignment as I had never used GitHub before, therefore this was an entirely unique experience for me. It's an interesting concept for a platform in the way that allows repositories to be displayed in a similar fashion to reddit, it seems like a very interactive and connective learning space that quite frankly I'm upset I never took advantage of before. I spent a significant amount of time familiarizing myself with the interface and collaborative functions that our group has access to as well as learning how to create and navigate through repositories. The ability to share and collaborate on code in an easy fashion is something that I believe is key to team projects, especially for groups like ours where a significant amount of the members have minimal time for in-person meetings.
  In regards to the importance of Software Configuration Management(SCM), there are a significant amount of benefits to be obtained through practice and application. When working with groups on coding assignments it can be difficult to effectively merge different portions of the final product, SCM allows us to continually update code and publish it in real time so members of the group can properly contribute when needed allowing for increased productivity. As well as that another benefit through SCM is to establish a baseline version of the software and concurrently ensure quality through audits that ensure all needs are satisfied. On top of those two reasons, SCM allows the group to esatablish team roles (Project Manager, Developer, Audtior, etc.) that maintain clarity in individual objectives and promote organizational habits that can make long term objectives much easier to accomplish.
